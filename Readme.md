#### On Windows:

```bash
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

### On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate


## Second
After activating the virtual environment, install the required Python packages using the requirements.txt file. Run:

pip install -r requirements.txt



## Third 
Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the main script test.py using the following command:

python test.py
